## Just start writing

I've been a Mac fanboy for a long time because for a long time, they had the better experience for me. I liked the ease of use that the OS offered, and it just felt nicer. Fast forward to 2020, and I've just had enough. The last 3 major releases have been such a huge disappointment that it didn't make sense to drop $2k on a machine that it's only half as good as its counterpart on Windows.

  ## Enlightenment: the XPS 9570

  I was shopping around when I saw that Wirecutter listed the newest Dell XPS 9570 ABOVE the newest Macbook laptop. Needless to say, I was impressed.
