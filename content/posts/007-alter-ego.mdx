Using his superhuman patience and imagination, he daydreamed so hard that it broke the universe that he knew, granting him access to all daydreams and to all possiblities. He could materialize anything he could imagine with his mind. He even brings back the dead at one point, to a horrible failure. With this failure in mind, he roams the streets in search of adventure.
