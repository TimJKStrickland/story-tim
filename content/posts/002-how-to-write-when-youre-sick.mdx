# Find yourself ill? Can't get up?

# Just start writing

I have a really hard time writing. It gets to the point that I have to trick myself into getting in front of a keyboard without an idea and just hacking away at a blank page hoping that something comes out.

Part of the reason that writing is so hard is that people want it to be perfect on the first go. Every single word must flow out of themselves like some muse.

```py
# I really can't make that happen. Real bad at it
```

## So what do I do if I have nothing to say right now?

Turns out, it doesn't matter. A lot of the time you'll have nothing of importance to say. Many times that you write you're going to have zero opinions, zero effect on the reader. Zero tolerance for the words you're writing. But it doesn't matter.

You're going to sit like I am now. You're going to pour until you can't stand the inner monologue. Until you honestly would rather retch. You're going to hate every single word that comes out. Nothing will be any good, and no one should ever read this.

### And then eventually you'll realize something

A lot of the time it just takes sitting down in one spot for long enough so that a thought enters your mind, and you can run with it. For example:

### I don't believe that being sick is taken seriously enough in an office setting.

Isn't it about time to make some changes?

I've been weirdly fatigued for the past week (probably because I got the flu and I should have gotten the flu shot), and I keep thinking of all the weird tasks that I can't do right now because my brains feels like a fried egg wrapped in an English biscuit.

```py
  when sick
    write()
  end
```
