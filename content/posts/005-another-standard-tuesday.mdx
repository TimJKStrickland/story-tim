# Big exciting news
I found out some big exciting news that I can't share just yet, but will alter my life entirely. A big part of the garden here will be devoted to how I handle this change, but I can't reveal just quite yet 😁

## In other news... 10 React projects in 10 weeks! 😅
I'm embarking on a new challenge! I want to create 10 React projects in 10 weeks. I want to showcase all that I've learned so far in one of the most popular libraries that ever hit the interwebs. I'm nervous about completing the whole project, but I'm confident that it's all part of the learning. 

Because I have to do this for my own sanity.
